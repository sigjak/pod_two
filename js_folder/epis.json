            "description": "Six-time Grammy winner Brandi Carlile got her start onstage as a kid, singing backup for an Elvis impersonator. Her new memoir, 'Broken Horses,' is about her early life and the family of misfits she's built. \"I think I'm starting to really feel sort of solid and loved in my world. Like maybe I've kind of finally found my place,\" she says.\n\nMaureen Corrigan reviews Kaitlyn Greenidge's novel 'Libertie.' \n\nPalestinian cookbook author Reem Kassis began gathering family recipes after the birth of her first child. The recipes, she says, \"could be the story of any and every Palestinian family.\" Her new cookbook is 'The Arabesque Table.'"
